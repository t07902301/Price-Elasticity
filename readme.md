# Price Elasticity Estimation and Sales Strategy Study

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing [price elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand) and studying sales strategies to optimize revenue from the [UK Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) and a [Promotion Plan](https://github.com/t07902301/Price-Elasticity/blob/e2babdd60b0662fb199f1aaa587fa6d0b4ec18ab/Promo%20Plan.csv). By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to understand how changes in price and other factors affect product demand and to evaluate the given promotion plan for improving sales performance.

## Steps

- Data Exploration and Processing
    - [Top 20 Products](EDA.ipynb)
    - [Promoted Products](promote_plan.ipynb)
- Build Estimation Model and Visualization: [Modelling.ipynb](Modelling.ipynb)

## Summary

Product demand estimation model considering current price, recent pricing distribution and seasonality by Fourier Transform, together with smoothed price data, gave us the highest evaluation score. Detailed summary is on *Product Demand Estimation.pdf*.
